# **Bitcoin Data Dashboard**
This is the front-end software for a streamlit application that displays statistical and up-to-date data regarding Bitcoin for use in Bitcoin hashing or mining. The software uses an open-source API provided by LuxorLabs to gather real-time data regarding Bitcoin and compiles the data into a convenient and much more visually appealing format. 

#### The data is displayed in the form of line charts, bar charts and area charts while also providing a statistical overview tabel.
